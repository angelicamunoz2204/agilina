/**
 * Screen map of the product. Every screen is lazy-loaded and arrives with the story that
 * builds it, inside the layout its mockup asks for: the team selector and its form in the
 * centered frame, the rest under the application header.
 *
 * Every tenant is an organization with its own login, so every screen lives under the tenant's
 * name (`/acme/teams`, AD-29): the first segment decides which realm signs the person in and
 * which database the API uses. `/` names no organization and is not found.
 *
 * Public screens: `/:tenant/activate` (the account activation, HU-02) and `/:tenant/status`
 * (the environment status, which proves that the application talks to the API). The entrance,
 * `/:tenant`, sends the signed-in to their teams and everybody else to sign in (HU-03). The
 * routes of the teams need a session: the guard takes the person to sign in and brings them
 * back to the page they asked for. It is comfort, not security: the API decides who sees a team.
 * That includes the team settings, which only an admin may open: no guard checks the role, since
 * it would hide the API's 403, and the screen shows "no access" with it.

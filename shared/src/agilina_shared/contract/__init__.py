"""Contract between the agent worker and the API.

The worker only needs two operations (architecture document, 5.3):

* get the ceremony context before joining the room;
* deliver the result when the ceremony ends.

Everything that crosses that boundary is here. An incompatible change in these
models breaks the contract between deployables and must be flagged with
``BREAKING CHANGE`` in the commit footer, besides bumping ``CONTRACT_VERSION``.

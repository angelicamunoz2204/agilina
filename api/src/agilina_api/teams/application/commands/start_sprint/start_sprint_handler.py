    """It does not check who asks: the route lets only the team's admins get here.

    The team is loaded first, which locks its row until the transaction ends (the same lock
    every change to its members takes), so starting a sprint and removing a member never
    interleave, and the participants are checked against the team's active members inside
    that transaction. A team has at most one active sprint: the use case asks
    ``ActiveSprints`` once the team is locked and refuses with ``ActiveSprintExistsError``;
    the ``sprint_one_active_per_team`` index backs it, and the repository answers the same
    error if it is ever reached. The sprint is stored ``active`` in one transaction with its
    participants. It returns only the new sprint's id (CQRS).

    Once committed, the start is logged with who asked.

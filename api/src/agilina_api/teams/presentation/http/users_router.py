"""Users API: the people of a team, their roles and their removal (HU-06), and the caller
as a member of a team, for the app header (HU-04).

A user has a different role in each team, so every route names the team in the query
(``?team_id=``). The answers are the same as in the rest of the API, in the same order: no
tenant ``400``, no session ``401``, not a member of the team ``403 not_a_team_member`` (the
same whether the team exists or not), a member who is not an admin ``403 not_a_team_admin``.
The role is always the stored one (``current_team_*_by_query``), never the label.

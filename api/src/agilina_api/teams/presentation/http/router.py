"""Teams API: create a team, list the authenticated user's teams and read one (HU-05) and
configure its active sprint (HU-07).

Every route needs an authenticated user, and that user is always the one behind the
access token (``current_user_id``), never one named in the body. A route about one team
is also kept to its members (``current_team_member``), and one that changes it to its admins
(``current_team_admin``). The users of a team (their roles, removing them) are the
``/v1/users`` API (``users_router``).

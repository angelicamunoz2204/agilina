"""Who is calling and whether they belong to the team, as FastAPI dependencies every
context can use.

A route that needs to know who is calling declares ``Depends(current_user_id)``: it gets
the ``app_user.id`` or the request ends in ``401 not_authenticated``.

A route about one team has ``{team_id}`` in its path and declares
``Depends(current_team_member)``: it gets the ``TeamContext`` with the caller's stored role,
or the request ends in ``403 not_a_team_member``. That is how every route of a team keeps
the other teams out (HU-05).

A route only an admin of the team may use declares ``Depends(current_team_admin)`` instead:
a member who is not an admin gets ``403 not_a_team_admin`` (HU-06).

The routes about the users of a team (``/v1/users``) are not under ``/v1/teams/{team_id}``:
they name the team in the query (``?team_id=``), because a user has a different role in each
team. ``current_team_member_by_query`` and ``current_team_admin_by_query`` are the same two
dependencies for them, with the same answers in the same order.

The adapters are declared here and provided by the composition root, so this layer never
imports the infrastructure one.

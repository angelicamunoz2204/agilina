"""Who is calling and what they may reach: the user of Agilina behind the bearer token of
a request, and their membership in the team the request is about.

Every context needs both and none of them owns them, so the ports live here. Validating the
token is the login story's job (HU-03); until then the composition root wires an adapter
that turns every token away (``bootstrap.authentication``).

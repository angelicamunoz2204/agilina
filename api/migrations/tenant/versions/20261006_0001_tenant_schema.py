"""tenant schema: what a tenant's database holds (identity and teams)

The whole schema of the database of one tenant, in one initial migration (AD-29): ``app_user``,
``team``, ``team_member``, ``invitation``, ``sprint`` and ``sprint_participant``, as the
reference schema (``agilina_schema.sql``) defines them, with the changes the stories made:
``team.created_by`` and ``invitation.created_by`` accept NULL, meaning "created by the platform
operator" (AD-22), and a team's name has at most 80 characters, which backs the ``TeamName``
rule of the domain (HU-05; ``char_length`` counts characters like Python's ``len`` does, so
both sides agree on the limit).

``sprint`` was created minimal by HU-06 (the team, the dates and the status: enough to answer
"does the team have a sprint in progress?") and HU-07 completes it: the daily's time as a UTC
anchor instant plus the IANA time zone it was captured in (AD-31; no column holds a local time),
and ``sprint_participant``, the daily's participants with their ``turn_order`` from 1. Both
foreign keys of a participant share its ``team_id``, so the database keeps every participant
someone who has been a member of the sprint's team. ``team_member`` rows are never deleted (a
removed member keeps theirs as ``removed``), so the foreign key cannot tell an active member
from a removed one: the ``Sprint`` aggregate admits only active members, and removing a member
takes them out of the active sprint's participants. The statuses are the glossary's (``planned``,
``active``, ``closed``), and the partial unique index makes the database keep a team to one
active sprint at most.

Development is local, so this migration is rewritten, not added to, while nobody else holds
data that depends on it: ``make clean`` and ``make up`` build every database from it. From the
first shared deployment on, a change is a new migration.

Written as SQL on purpose, like every migration of this project: enums, triggers and
partial indexes are not something autogenerate reproduces, and the foreign keys between
contexts live here and not in the ORM models (each context's models know only their own
tables).
